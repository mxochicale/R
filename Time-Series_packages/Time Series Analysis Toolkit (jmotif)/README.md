jmotif: Time Series Analysis Toolkit Based on Symbolic Aggregate Dicretization, i.e. SAX
---


Implements time series z-normalization, SAX, HOT-SAX, VSM, SAX-VSM, RePair, and
RRA algorithms facilitating time series motif (i.e., recurrent pattern),
discord (i.e., anomaly), and characteristic pattern discovery along with
interpretable time series classification.
