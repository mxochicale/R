* [ ]  incorporate examples from this tutorial: https://www.listendata.com/2016/10/r-data-table.html
	where I found this helpful instruction:

```	
Subsetting Rows / Filtering

* Suppose you are asked to find all the flights whose origin is 'JFK'. Filter based on one variable
dat8 = mydata[origin == "JFK"]

* Select Multiple Values. Filter all the flights whose origin is either 'JFK' or 'LGA'
dat9 = mydata[origin %in% c("JFK", "LGA")]
```
