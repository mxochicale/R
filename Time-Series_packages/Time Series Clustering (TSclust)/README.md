TSclust: Time Series Clustering Utilities
---

This package contains a set of measures of dissimilarity between time series
to perform time series clustering. Metrics based on raw data, on generating
models and on the forecast behavior are implemented. Some additional utilities
related to time series clustering are also provided, such as clustering
algorithms and cluster evaluation metrics.
