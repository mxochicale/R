r-code Source Repository
==============



# Basic R-rules

* Be minimal and light when you are in R coding, you do not know
how time comsuming is the migration of data and no documented source code.
* Avoid any heavy files which means that you have to add description on where and how to download those huge files
or paths,   

# File Structure description
  * .Rhistory
  * README.md
  * *.R files*

# TO-DO list
* Create a README.md per path for which a brief description
   of the R scripts have to be made.
* Create and easy way to migrate main_data_directory
