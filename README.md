we must be prepared to set aside old
procedures when better ones are
developed, just as is done in other
areas of science"*  ~ W.S. Cleveland, 1983


# Basic coding R-rules

These are some general suggestions to make the code portable, transferable and usable.

* Be minimal and light when you are coding in R (or any programming language).
* The migration of data and no documented source code is usually time consuming
and a waste of time.
* Avoid any heavy files which means that you have to add description on where
and how to download those huge files or paths.
* Start your code indicating authorship, last update, and contact info
and provide an outline of the code structure and through the code use the same numbers
so people can naviage the code easily. Comment the code every three lines [:link:](http://datacolada.org/69)
