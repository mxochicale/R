nonlinearTseries: Nonlinear Time Series Analysis
---

After contacting Constantino-Garcia, the developer [1] of [`nonlinearTseries` package](https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries),
I forked the project [in this repository](https://github.com/mxochicale/nonlinearTseries) to make my own experiments.



* Default Installation
```
install.packages("nonlinearTseries", repos='https://www.stats.bris.ac.uk/R/')
```

These are some links related to the package and the developer:

Dear Constantino,

Thank you very much for the excellent job that you are doing with the
"nonlinearTseries" package. I have been doing some experimentations in the last
year with the use of Cao's algorithm but I wraped the [fortran code](http://www.atomosyd.net/spip.php?article128) from C LETELLIER in R. Today, I foundthat you put everything in that beautiful package
which is super cool. I am wondering if you have a GitHub repository for the package,
it would be nice to make some contributions and post some doubts and requirements
that I mgiht implement if you don't have the time.

Best,
[Miguel Xochicale](https://github.com/mxochicale)

Dear Miguel, 

Just published it to github: https://github.com/constantino-garcia/nonlinearTseries 
The last changes were quick and dirty, but I didn't want to make you wait too long. 
Thank you for your interest! It inspired me to finish the porting.
