In case that you want to automatically download your scripts.

These ( [1](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/HAR-stacked-residual-bidir-LSTMs/tree/master/data) [2](https://github.com/guillaume-chevalier/LSTM-Human-Activity-Recognition/tree/master/data) ) repos
are very helpful to implement "download_datasets.py" python scripts.


```
$  python download_datasets.py
```
