# Here we see the V matrix is the same as the output of the svd() but with some
# sign changes. These sign changes can happen, as mentioned earlier, as the
# eigenvector scaled by âˆ’1 is still the same eigenvector, just scaled.
# We will alter the signs of our calculated V
#



# to match the output of the svd() function.

# Our answers align with the output of the svd() function. We can also show that the matrix A
