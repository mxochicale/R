R Source Code Repository
---

*If progress is to be made in graphics,
we must be prepared to set aside old
procedures when better ones are
developed, just as is done in other
areas of science.*  ~ W.S. Cleveland, 1983


# Basic R-rules

* Be minimal and light when you are coding in R (or any programming language).
* The migration of data and no documented source code is usually time consuming
and a waste of time.
* Avoid any heavy files which means that you have to add description on where
and how to download those huge files or paths.

# File Structure description
  * .Rhistory
  * README.md
  * *.R files*


# [References](https://github.com/mxochicale/r-code_repository/blob/master/README.md)


# TODO
* Create a README.md for each path for which a brief description
   of the R scripts have to be made.
* Create and easy way to migrate main_data_directory
