R Source Code Repository
===

*""If progress is to be made in graphics,
we must be prepared to set aside old
procedures when better ones are
developed, just as is done in other
areas of science."*  ~ W.S. Cleveland, 1983



# Basic R-rules

* Be minimal and light when you are in R coding, you do not know
how time comsuming is the migration of data and no documented source code.
* Avoid any heavy files which means that you have to add description on where and how to download those huge files
or paths,   

# File Structure description
  * .Rhistory
  * README.md
  * *.R files*



# Useful References
* [Free course for R](http://tryr.codeschool.com/)

# TODO
* Create a README.md per path for which a brief description
   of the R scripts have to be made.
* Create and easy way to migrate main_data_directory
